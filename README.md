Opauth
=======
__This project is still under heavy development. DO NOT USE.__  
Initial stable release is scheduled for late May 2012.

Opauth is a multi-provider authentication framework for PHP, inspired by [OmniAuth for Ruby](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth).

What is Opauth?
---------------
Opauth provides a standardized method for PHP applications to interface with 3rd-party authentication providers. 

Opauth as a framework provides a set of API that allows developers to [create strategies](https://github.com/uzyn/opauth/wiki/Strategy-Contribution-Guide) that work in a predictable manner across PHP frameworks and applications.

Opauth is designed works well with PHP applications & frameworks.  
It is currently supported on [vanilla (plain) PHP applications](https://github.com/uzyn/opauth/tree/master/example) *(of course)*, [CakePHP](https://github.com/uzyn/cakephp-opauth), [Yii Framework](https://github.com/kahwee/yii-opauth) and more to come.  
If your PHP framework of choice is not yet listed, you can still use Opauth like you would a normal PHP component (class).

Quick start
-----------
1. Set `DocumentRoot` of your web server to `example/`.  
   (Opauth can be instantiated in your own PHP app, but we will leave that out of this quick start guide)

2. Configure Opauth  
   `cp example/opauth.conf.php.default example/opauth.conf.php`  
   and make the necessary changes.

3. Install some [Opauth strategies](https://github.com/uzyn/opauth/wiki/List-of-strategies).  
   We recommend that you start with [Opauth-Facebook](https://github.com/uzyn/opauth-facebook)

4. Send user to `http://path_to_opauth/facebook` to authenticate.
