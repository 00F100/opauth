Welcome to Opauth's documentation!
==================================

Opauth is a multi-provider authentication framework for PHP, inspired by `OmniAuth for Ruby <https://github.com/intridea/omniauth>`_

Opauth enables PHP applications to do *user authentication* with ease, by providing a standardized method for PHP
applications to interface with authentication providers.
