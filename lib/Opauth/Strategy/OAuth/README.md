Opauth OAuth
=============
[Opauth][1] strategy implementing OAuth, using [tmhOAuth](https://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth).

Getting Started, or not
-----------------------
Not quite a fully functional Opauth strategy yet.

It is currently mainly used to provide OAuth support for other Opauth strategies, eg. Twitter.

Dependencies
------------

### For tmhOAuth:
>The library has been tested with PHP 5.3+ and relies on CURL and hash_hmac. The vast majority of hosting providers include >these libraries and run with PHP 5.1+.
>
>The code makes use of hash_hmac, which was introduced in PHP 5.1.2. If your version of PHP is lower than this you should ask >your hosting provider for an update.
